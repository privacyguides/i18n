## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

!!! example "This section is new"

    We are working on establishing defined criteria for every section of our site, and this may be subject to change. If you have any questions about our criteria, please [ask on our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) and don't assume we didn't consider something when making our recommendations if it is not listed here. There are many factors considered and discussed when we recommend a project, and documenting every single one is a work-in-progress.

- Must be open-source software.
- Must operate locally, i.e. must not be a cloud service.

## Social Media RSS Support

Some social media services also support RSS although it's not often advertised.

### Reddit

Reddit allows you to subscribe to subreddits via RSS.

!!! example
    Replace `subreddit_name` with the subreddit you wish to subscribe to.

    ```text
    https://www.reddit.com/r/{{ subreddit_name }}/new/.rss
    ```

### Twitter

Using any of the Nitter [instances](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances) you can easily subscribe using RSS.

!!! example
    1. Pick an instance and set `nitter_instance`.
    2. Replace `twitter_account` with the account name.

       ```
