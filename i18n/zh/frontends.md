    **Librarian** is a free and open-source frontend for [Odysee](https://odysee.com/) (LBRY) that is also self-hostable.

!!! 推荐

    Librarian does not proxy video streams by default. Videos watched through Librarian will still make direct connections to Odysee's servers (e.g. `odycdn.com`); however, some instances may enable proxying which would be detailed in the instance's privacy policy.

!!! tip

    Librarian is useful if you want watch LBRY content on mobile without mandatory telemetry and if you want to disable JavaScript in your browser, as is the case with [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) on the Safest security level.

When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance as well in order for you to blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting Librarian, as other peoples' usage will be linked to your hosting.

When you are using a Librarian instance, make sure to read the privacy policy of that specific instance. Librarian instances can be modified by their owners and therefore may not reflect the default policy. Librarian instances feature a "privacy nutrition label" to provide an overview of their policy. Some instances have Tor .onion addresses which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries don't contain PII.

    Invidious does not proxy video streams by default. Videos watched through Invidious will still make direct connections to Google's servers (e.g. `googlevideo.com`); however, some instances support video proxying—simply enable *Proxy videos* within the instances' settings or add `&local=true` to the URL.

!!! tip

    Invidious is useful if you want to disable JavaScript in your browser, such as [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) on the Safest security level. It does not provide privacy by itself, and we don’t recommend logging into any accounts.

When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance as well in order for you to blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting Invidious, as other peoples' usage will be linked to your hosting.
