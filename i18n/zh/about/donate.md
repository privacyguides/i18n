Donate to Privacy Guides and support our mission to defend digital rights and spread the word about mass surveillance programs and other daily privacy invasions. You can help Privacy Guides researchers, activists, and maintainers create informative content, host private digital services, and protect privacy rights at a time when the world needs it most.

Privacy Guides has been a nonstop effort for over 5 years to stay up to date with the world of cybersecurity and privacy, and to promote the benefits of privacy overall. This is a **non-profit, community-driven** project that would not be possible without the generous support of all our [contributors](contributors.md).

## Donate

Currently, the best way to support our work is to send a monthly or one-time contribution via GitHub Sponsors. We will be able to accept donations via alternate payment platforms very soon.

[:material-heart:{ .pg-red } Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/privacyguides){ class="md-button md-button--primary" }

A new donation platform we control to make donating easier will be deployed soon. In the meantime, if you'd like to arrange a donation (including with cryptocurrency), please reach out to [info@magicgrants.org](mailto:info@magicgrants.org).

## 我们如何使用捐赠费

隐私指南是一个 **非营利性** 组织。 我们将捐款用于各种目的，包括。

**虚拟主机**
:

本网站的流量每月使用数百千兆字节的数据，我们使用各种服务提供商来跟上这种流量。

**Domain Registrations**
:

We have a few domain names like `privacyguides.org` which cost us around $10 yearly to maintain their registration.

**在线服务**
:

We host [internet services](services.md) for testing and showcasing different privacy-products we like and [recommend](../tools.md). Some of them are made publicly available for our community's use (SearXNG, Tor, etc.), and some are provided for our team members (email, etc.).

**购买商品**
:

我们偶尔会购买产品和服务，以测试我们 [推荐的工具](../tools.md)。

Your donation will go to a [dedicated fund](https://magicgrants.org/funds/privacy_guides) within [MAGIC Grants](https://magicgrants.org), a 501(c)(3) organization. The funds will only be used for this project specifically. You may qualify for a tax deduction. If you need a donation receipt, please email <info@magicgrants.org>.

Thank you to all those who support our mission! :material-heart:{ .pg-red }

We strictly **cannot** use donations to support political campaigns/candidates or attempt to influence legislation. Earnings also will **not** inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
