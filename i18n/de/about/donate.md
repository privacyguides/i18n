title: Supporting Us
---

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->
It takes a lot of [people](contributors.md) and [work](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pulse/monthly) to keep Privacy Guides up to date and spreading the word about privacy and mass surveillance. Wenn dir gefällt, was wir tun, kannst du dich beteiligen, indem du [die Website bearbeitest](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org) oder [Übersetzungen](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides) beisteuerst.

## Donate

Currently, the best way to support our work is to send a monthly or one-time contribution via GitHub Sponsors. We will be able to accept donations via alternate payment platforms very soon.

[:material-heart:{ .pg-red } Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/privacyguides){ class="md-button md-button--primary" }

We are also working with our fiscal host to receive cryptocurrency donations, at the moment the accounting is unfeasible for many smaller transactions, but this should change in the near future. In the meantime, if you still wish to make a cryptocurrency donation, please reach out to [jonah@privacyguides.org](mailto:jonah@privacyguides.org) to arrange a transaction.

## Merchandise

Another option to support us is by buying our merchandise from HelloTux. We get a small commission for each item sold, and you get a quality product to show for it.

## How We Use Donations

Privacy Guides is a **non-profit** organization. We use donations for a variety of purposes, including:

**Domain Registrations**
:

We have a few domain names like `privacyguides.org` which cost us around $10 yearly to maintain their registration.

**Web Hosting**
:

Traffic to this website uses hundreds of gigabytes of data per month, we use a variety of service providers to keep up with this traffic.

**Online Services**
:

We host [internet services](https://privacyguides.net) for testing and showcasing different privacy-products we like and [recommend](../tools.md). Some of which are made publicly available for our community's use (SearXNG, Tor, etc.), and some are provided for our team members (email, etc.).

**Product Purchases**
:

We occasionally purchase products and services for the purposes of testing our [recommended tools](../tools.md).

Your donation will go to a dedicated fund within [MAGIC Grants](https://magicgrants.org), a 501(c)(3) organization. The funds will only be used for this project specifically. You may qualify for a tax deduction. If you need a donation receipt, please email <info@magicgrants.org>.

Thank you to all those who support our mission! :material-heart:{ .pg-red }
