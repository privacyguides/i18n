icon: material/email-open
description: These email clients are privacy-respecting and support OpenPGP email encryption.
---

Our recommendation list contains email clients that support both [OpenPGP](encryption.md#openpgp) and strong authentication such as [Open Authorization (OAuth)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth). OAuth allows you to use [Multi-Factor Authentication](basics/multi-factor-authentication.md) and prevent account theft.

??? warning "Email does not provide forward secrecy"

    When using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) technology like OpenPGP, email will still have [some metadata](email.md#email-metadata-overview) that is not encrypted in the header of the email.
    
    OpenPGP also does not support [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), which means if either your or the recipient's private key is ever stolen, all previous messages encrypted with it will be exposed: [How do I protect my private keys?](basics/email-security.md) Consider using a medium that provides forward secrecy:

#### Recommended Configuration

We recommend changing some of these settings to make Thunderbird a little more private.

These options can be found in :material-menu: → **Settings** → **Privacy & Security**.

##### Web Content

- [ ] Uncheck  **Remember websites and links I've visited**
- [ ] Uncheck  **Accept cookies from sites**

##### Telemetry

- [ ] Uncheck  **Allow Thunderbird to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla**

#### Thunderbird-user.js (advanced)

[`thunderbird-user.js`](https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/thunderbird-user.js), is a set of configurations options that aims to disable as many of the web-browsing features within Thunderbird as possible in order to reduce surface area and maintain privacy. Some of the changes are backported from the [Arkenfox project](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).

## Platform Specific

### Apple Mail (macOS)

!!! warning

    Canary Mail only recently released a Windows and Android client, though we don't believe they are as stable as their iOS and Mac counterparts.

Canary Mail is closed-source. We recommend it due to the few choices there are for email clients on iOS that support PGP E2EE.

    We are working on establishing defined criteria for every section of our site, and this may be subject to change. If you have any questions about our criteria, please [ask on our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) and don't assume we didn't consider something when making our recommendations if it is not listed here. There are many factors considered and discussed when we recommend a project, and documenting every single one is a work-in-progress.

### Minimum Qualifications

- Apps developed for open-source operating systems must be open-source.
- Must not collect telemetry, or have an easy way to disable all telemetry.
- Must support OpenPGP message encryption.

### Best-Case

Our best-case criteria represents what we would like to see from the perfect project in this category. Our recommendations may not include any or all of this functionality, but those which do may rank higher than others on this page.

- Should be open-source.
- Should be cross-platform.
- Should not collect any telemetry by default.
- Should support OpenPGP natively, i.e. without extensions.
- Should support storing OpenPGP encrypted emails locally.
