## 我为什么要引起注意？

> “I have nothing to hide. Why should I care about my privacy?”

与跨种族间婚姻权、妇女选举权、言论自由和许多其他权利一样，我们的隐私权并非总是存在和得到保障。 在一些独裁国家中，近乎完全不存在隐私。 Generations before ours fought for our right to privacy. ===隐私是我们每个人与生俱来的人权，===我们有权享有(不受歧视)。

您不应该将隐私与保密混为一谈。 即使我们都知道浴室会发生什么，但您还是关上了门。 那是因为你想要隐私，而不是对此保密。 **每个人**都有需要保护的东西。 隐私是我们之所以为人的原因。

## What should I do?

> First, you need to make a plan

Trying to protect all your data from everyone all the time is impractical, expensive, and exhausting. 但是别担心！ 安全是一个过程，并且通过向前思考，你可以制定出一个适合你的计划。 Security isn't just about the *privacy tools* you use or the software you download. 相反，它始于了解你所面临的独特的威胁，以及解决它们的办法。

==This process of identifying threats and defining countermeasures is called **threat modeling**==, and it forms the basis of every good security and privacy plan.

## About Privacy Guides

![Privacy Guides logo](assets/brand/logos/png/square/pg-yellow.png){ align=right loading=lazy }

Established in 2021 due to the difficulty of finding unbiased reviewers in the VPN and privacy space, **Privacy Guides** is the most popular, trustworthy, non-profit website that provides information about protecting your *personal* data security and privacy. Our crowdsourced recommendations and reviews of **privacy tools** and our community dedicated to helping others set us apart from other blogs and content creators. The team behind this project has been researching privacy and security in the open-source space for over 5 years, originally with a now-defunct web resource that eventually became the *Privacy Guides* millions of readers trust.

*Our website is free of advertisements and not affiliated with any of the listed providers.*

As seen in **WIRED**, **Tweakers.net**, **The New York Times**, and many other publications as a reliable source for privacy and security knowledge.

## What are privacy tools?

We recommend a wide variety of **privacy tools** (a.k.a. *privacy apps*, *privacy utilities*, *privacy software*) spanning software and hardware that you can use to improve your privacy. Many of the tools we recommend are completely free to use and open-source software, while some are commercial services available for purchase. Switching from mainstream data-hungry software like Google Chrome and Windows to privacy-focused tools like [Brave](desktop-browsers.md#brave) and [Linux](desktop.md) can go a long way towards controlling the information you share with companies and others.

## Why does privacy matter?

In the modern age of digital data exploitation, your privacy has never been more critical, yet many believe it is already a lost cause. 事实并非如此。 ==Your privacy is up for grabs, and you need to care about it.== Privacy is about power, and it is so important that this power ends up in the right hands.

Many people get the concepts of privacy, security, and anonymity confused. 例如，你会看到有人批评各种产品 "不私密"，但他们的意思其实是这些产品不提供匿名性。 在本网站上，我们这三个主题都会介绍，但重要的是，你要了解它们之间的区别，以及每一个主题何时发挥作用。
