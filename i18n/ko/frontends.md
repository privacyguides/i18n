description: These open-source frontends for various internet services allow you to access content without JavaScript or other annoyances.
cover: frontends.webp
---

Sometimes services will try to force you to sign up for an account by blocking access to content with annoying popups. They might also break without JavaScript enabled. These frontends can allow you to get around these restrictions.

If you choose to self-host these frontends, it is important that you have other people using your instance as well in order for you to blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting, as other peoples' usage will be linked to your hosting.

When you are using an instance run by someone else, make sure to read the privacy policy of that specific instance. They can be modified by their owners and therefore may not reflect the default policy. Some instances have [Tor](tor.md) .onion addresses which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries don't contain PII.

## 평가 기준

**Privacy Guides는 권장 목록의 어떠한 프로젝트와도 제휴를 맺지 않았습니다.** 객관적인 권장 목록을 제공하기 위해, [일반적인 평가 기준](about/criteria.md)에 더해 명확한 요구 사항을 정립하였습니다. 어떠한 프로젝트를 선택해 사용하기 전에, 이러한 요구 사항들을 숙지하고 여러분 스스로 조사하는 과정을 거쳐 적절한 선택을 하시기 바랍니다.

<div class="admonition example" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">This section is new</p>

Privacy Guides 팀은 사이트의 모든 항목마다 명확한 평가 기준을 정립하는 중이며, 따라서 세부 내용은 변경될 수 있습니다. 평가 기준에 대해서 질문이 있다면 [포럼에서 문의](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest)하시기 바랍니다. (무언가가 목록에 존재하지 않다고 해서 권장 목록을 작성할 때 고려한 적이 없을 것으로 단정 짓지 마세요.) 권장 목록에 어떤 프로젝트를 추가할 때 고려하고 논의해야 할 요소는 매우 많으며, 모든 요소를 문서화하는 것은 현재 진행 중인 작업입니다.
