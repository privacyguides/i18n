Encrypted DNS with third-party servers should only be used to get around basic [DNS blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_blocking) when you can be sure there won't be any consequences. DNS criptografado não o ajudará a ocultar qualquer atividade de navegação.

## Provedores recomendados

These are our favorite public DNS resolvers based on their privacy and security characteristics, and their worldwide performance. Some of these services offer basic DNS-level blocking of malware or trackers depending on the server you choose, but if you want to be able to see and customize what is blocked you should use a dedicated DNS filtering product instead.

## Self-Hosted DNS Filtering

A self-hosted DNS solution is useful for providing filtering on controlled platforms, such as Smart TVs and other IoT devices, as no client-side software is needed.

### Pi-hole

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Pi-hole logo](assets/img/dns/pi-hole.svg){ align=right }

**Pi-hole** is an open-source [DNS-sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) which uses [DNS filtering](https://cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dns-filtering) to block unwanted web content, such as advertisements.

Pi-hole is designed to be hosted on a Raspberry Pi, but it is not limited to such hardware. The software features a friendly web interface to view insights and manage blocked content.

**AdGuard Home** is an open-source [DNS-sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) which uses [DNS filtering](https://cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dns-filtering) to block unwanted web content, such as advertisements.

AdGuard Home features a polished web interface to view insights and manage blocked content.

## Cloud-Based DNS Filtering

These DNS filtering solutions offer a web dashboard where you can customize the blocklists to your exact needs, similarly to a Pi-hole. These services are usually easier to set up and configure than self-hosted services like the ones above, and can be used more easily across multiple networks (self-hosted solutions are typically restricted to your home/local network unless you set up a more advanced configuration).

### ControlID

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Control D logo](assets/img/dns/control-d.svg){ align=right }

**Control D** is a customizable DNS service which lets you block security threats, unwanted content, and advertisements on a DNS level. In addition to their paid plans, they offer a number of preconfigured DNS resolvers you can use for free.

### PróximoDNS

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![NextDNS logo](assets/img/dns/nextdns.svg){ align=right }

**NextDNS** is a customizable DNS service which lets you block security threats, unwanted content, and advertisements on a DNS level. They offer a fully functional free plan for limited use.

</div>

When used with an account, NextDNS will enable insights and logging features by default (as some features require it). You can choose retention time and log storage location for any logs you choose to keep, or disable logs altogether.

NextDNS's free plan is fully functional, but should not be relied upon for security or other critical filtering applications, because after 300,000 DNS queries in a month all filtering, logging, and other account-based functionality is disabled. It can still be used as a regular DNS provider after that point, so your devices will continue to function and make secure queries via DNS-over-HTTPS, just without your filter lists.

NextDNS also offers public DNS-over-HTTPS service at `https://dns.nextdns.io` and DNS-over-TLS/QUIC at `dns.nextdns.io`, which are available by default in Firefox and Chromium, and subject to their default no-logging [privacy policy](https://nextdns.io/privacy).

## Proxies DNS encriptados

Encrypted DNS proxy software provides a local proxy for the [unencrypted DNS](advanced/dns-overview.md#unencrypted-dns) resolver to forward to. Typically, it is used on platforms that don't natively support [encrypted DNS](advanced/dns-overview.md#what-is-encrypted-dns).

### RethinkDNS

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![RethinkDNS logo](assets/img/android/rethinkdns.svg#only-light){ align=right }
![RethinkDNS logo](assets/img/android/rethinkdns-dark.svg#only-dark){ align=right }

**RethinkDNS** is an open-source Android client that supports [DNS-over-HTTPS](advanced/dns-overview.md#dns-over-https-doh), [DNS-over-TLS](advanced/dns-overview.md#dns-over-tls-dot), [DNSCrypt](advanced/dns-overview.md#dnscrypt) and DNS Proxy. It also provides additional functionality such as caching DNS responses, locally logging DNS queries, and using the app as a firewall.

While RethinkDNS takes up the Android VPN slot, you can still use a VPN or Orbot with the app by [adding a Wireguard configuration](https://docs.rethinkdns.com/proxy/wireguard) or [manually configuring Orbot as a Proxy server](https://docs.rethinkdns.com/firewall/orbot), respectively.

### dnscrypt-proxy

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![dnscrypt-proxy logo](assets/img/dns/dnscrypt-proxy.svg){ align=right }

**dnscrypt-proxy** is a DNS proxy with support for [DNSCrypt](advanced/dns-overview.md#dnscrypt), [DNS-over-HTTPS](advanced/dns-overview.md#dns-over-https-doh), and [Anonymized DNS](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Anonymized-DNS).

## Framadate

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

All DNS products must support:

- [DNSSEC](advanced/dns-overview.md#what-is-dnssec).
- [QNAME Minimization](advanced/dns-overview.md#what-is-qname-minimization).
- Anonymize [ECS](advanced/dns-overview.md#what-is-edns-client-subnet-ecs) or disable it by default.

Additionally, all public providers:

- Prefer [anycast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast#Addressing_methods) support or geo-steering support.
- Must not log any personal data to disk
    - As noted in our footnotes, some providers collect query information for example, for purposes like security research, but in that case that data must not be associated with any PII such as IP address, etc.
