  FAQ
</h2>

<h3 spaces-before="0">
  What is an organizational membership?
</h3>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Organizational membership to Privacy Guides is open to any company, private foundation, or organization that donates at least $5,000 per year. While Privacy Guides does not endorse private companies or their products, we're grateful for their contributions. Your donation may be tax-deductible, and we will provide you with a receipt.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  You can become an organizational member by reaching out to <a href="mailto:info@magicgrants.org" x-nc="1">info@magicgrants.org</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3 spaces-before="0">
  How are organizational members recognized?
</h3>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Organizational members that choose to be recognized publicly are included in our organizational members section (above), and occasionally at other opportunities where appropriate. Organizational member links include the <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attribute: We adopted this policy to screen out potential abuse of our program and site to raise the rank of third parties in search algorithms. Unfortunately, this is a growing problem for nonprofits. This was a complex decision since we know many of the sincere supporters behind these companies, but we decided that it was the best choice for us.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Organizational members have no ability to influence what content is recommended on the Privacy Guides website. Learn more about our <a href="donation-acceptance-policy.md">donation acceptance policy</a>.

<h3 spaces-before="0">
  What is an active membership?
</h3>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Your monthly or yearly membership sustains Privacy Guides's services and public activism for privacy and cybersecurity year round. If you become a member, we will recognize your support here on our website, our community forum, and occasionally in other areas like our videos if you choose to make your membership publicly known.
</p>

<p spaces-before="0">
  Our membership program is brand new, and we are still exploring other ways that we can share a token of our appreciation with you, while maintaining sustainable and ethical boundaries. Stay tuned!
