## 我们从访客那里收集的数据

我们非常重视网站访问者的隐私，因此我们不会跟踪任何个人。 作为我们网站的访问者：

- No personal information is stored
- No information is shared with, sent to or sold to third-parties
- No information is shared with advertising companies
- No information is mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends
- No information is monetized

You can view the data we collect on our [statistics](statistics.md) page.

We run a self-hosted installation of [Umami](https://umami.is) to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only, and no personal data is stored.

The only data which is collected is data sent in a standard web request, which includes referral sources, the page you're visiting, your user agent, your IP address, and your screen resolution. The raw data is immediately discarded after statistics have been generated, for example if we collect your screen resolution as `1125x2436`, the only data we retain is "mobile device" and not your specific resolution.

## 我们从账户持有人处收集的数据

If you register for an account on one of our services, we may collect any information you provide us (such as your email, password, profile information, etc.) and use that information to provide you with the service. We never share or sell this data.

Some services we host have separate privacy policies which supersede this document. For example, the privacy policy of our forum can be found at [discuss.privacyguides.net/privacy](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/privacy).

## 联系我们

Even in the limited cases where your data is collected, our volunteers and most members of the Privacy Guides team have no access to that information. Some information (such as your email address) may be accessible to moderators via limited control panels for the purposes of moderating our communities.

Thus, inquiries regarding your personal information should be sent directly to:

```text
Jonah Aragon
服务管理员
jonah@privacyguides.org
```

对于所有其他查询，你可以联系我们团队的任何成员。

For complaints under GDPR more generally, you always have the option to lodge complaints with your local data protection supervisory authorities.
