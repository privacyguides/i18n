!!! example "Work in Progress"

    The following page is a work in progress, and does not reflect the full criteria for our recommendations at this time. Past discussion on this topic: [#24](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/discussions/24)

Below are some things that must apply to all submissions to Privacy Guides. Each category will have additional requirements for inclusion.

## Financial Disclosure

We do not make money from recommending certain products, we do not use affiliate links, and we do not provide special consideration to project donors.

## General Guidelines

We apply these priorities when considering new recommendations:

- **Secure**: Tools should follow security best-practices wherever applicable.
- **Source Availability**: Open source projects are generally preferred over equivalent proprietary alternatives.
- **Cross-Platform**: We typically prefer recommendations to be cross-platform, to avoid vendor lock-in.
- **Active Development**: The tools that we recommend should be actively developed, unmaintained projects will be removed in most cases.
- **Usability**: Tools should be accessible to most computer users, an overly technical background should not be required.
- **Documented**: Tools should have clear and extensive documentation for use.

## Developer Self-Submissions

We have these requirements in regard to developers which wish to submit their project or software for consideration.

- Must disclose affiliation, i.e. your position within the project being submitted.

- Must have a security whitepaper if it is a project that involves handling of sensitive information like a messenger, password manager, encrypted cloud storage etc.
    - Third party audit status. We want to know if you have one, or have one planned. If possible please mention who will be conducting the audit.

- Must explain what the project brings to the table in regard to privacy.
    - Does it solve any new problem?
    - Why should anyone use it over the alternatives?

- Must state what the exact threat model is with their project.
    - It should be clear to potential users what the project can provide, and what it cannot.
