These are our currently recommended desktop web browsers and configurations for standard/non-anonymous browsing. We recommend [Mullvad Browser](#mullvad-browser) if you are focused on strong privacy protections and anti-fingerprinting out of the box, [Firefox](#firefox) for casual internet browsers looking for a good alternative to Google Chrome, and [Brave](#brave) if you need Chromium browser compatibility.

Om du vill surfa anonymt på internet bör du använda [Tor](tor.md) i stället. We make some configuration recommendations on this page, but all browsers other than Tor Browser will be traceable by *somebody* in some manner or another.

## Mullvad Browser

!!! recommendation

    ![Mullvad Browser logo](assets/img/browsers/mullvad_browser.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Mullvad Browser** is a version of [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) with Tor network integrations removed, aimed at providing Tor Browser's anti-fingerprinting browser technologies to VPN users. It is developed by the Tor Project and distributed by [Mullvad](vpn.md#mullvad), and does **not** require the use of Mullvad's VPN.

        - [:simple-windows11: Windows](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/windows)
        - [:simple-apple: macOS](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/macos)
        - [:simple-linux: Linux](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/linux)

Like [Tor Browser](tor.md), Mullvad Browser is designed to prevent fingerprinting by making your browser fingerprint identical to all other Mullvad Browser users, and it includes default settings and extensions that are automatically configured by the default security levels: *Standard*, *Safer* and *Safest*. Therefore, it is imperative that you do not modify the browser at all outside adjusting the default [security levels](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/). Other modifications would make your fingerprint unique, defeating the purpose of using this browser. If you want to configure your browser more heavily and fingerprinting is not a concern for you, we recommend [Firefox](#firefox) instead.

### Anti-Fingerprinting

**Without** using a [VPN](vpn.md), Mullvad Browser provides the same protections against [naive fingerprinting scripts](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.3-Overrides-%5BTo-RFP-or-Not%5D#-fingerprinting) as other private browsers like Firefox+[Arkenfox](#arkenfox-advanced) or [Brave](#brave). Mullvad Browser provides these protections out of the box, at the expense of some flexibility and convenience that other private browsers can provide.

==For the strongest anti-fingerprinting protection, we recommend using Mullvad Browser in conjunction **with** a VPN==, whether that is Mullvad or another recommended VPN provider. When using a VPN with Mullvad Browser, you will share a fingerprint and a pool of IP addresses with many other users, giving you a "crowd" to blend in with. This strategy is the only way to thwart advanced tracking scripts, and is the same anti-fingerprinting technique used by Tor Browser.

Note that while you can use Mullvad Browser with any VPN provider, other people on that VPN must also be using Mullvad Browser for this "crowd" to exist, something which is more likely on Mullvad VPN compared to other providers, particularly this close to the launch of Mullvad Browser. Mullvad Browser does not have built-in VPN connectivity, nor does it check whether you are using a VPN before browsing; your VPN connection has to be configured and managed separately.

Mullvad Browser comes with the *uBlock Origin* and *NoScript* browser extensions pre-installed. While we typically [don't recommend](#extensions) adding *additional* browser extensions, these extensions that come pre-installed with the browser should **not** be removed or configured outside their default values, because doing so would noticeably make your browser fingerprint distinct from other Mullvad Browser users. It also comes pre-installed with the Mullvad Browser Extension, which *can* be safely removed without impacting your browser fingerprint if you would like, but is also safe to keep even if you don't use Mullvad VPN.

### Private Browsing Mode

Mullvad Browser operates in permanent private browsing mode, meaning your history, cookies, and other site data will always be cleared every time the browser is closed. Your bookmarks, browser settings, and extension settings will still be preserved.

This is required to prevent advanced forms of tracking, but does come at the cost of convenience and some Firefox features, such as Multi-Account Containers. Remember you can always use multiple browsers, for example, you could consider using Firefox+Arkenfox for a few sites that you want to stay logged in on or otherwise don't work properly in Mullvad Browser, and Mullvad Browser for general browsing.

### Mullvad Leta

Mullvad Browser comes with DuckDuckGo set as the default [search engine](search-engines.md), but it also comes preinstalled with **Mullvad Leta**, a search engine which requires an active Mullvad VPN subscription to access. Mullvad Leta queries Google's paid search API directly (which is why it is limited to paying subscribers), however because of this limitation it is possible for Mullvad to correlate search queries and Mullvad VPN accounts. For this reason we discourage the use of Mullvad Leta, even though Mullvad collects very little information about their VPN subscribers.

## Firefox

!!! recommendation

    ![Firefox logo](assets/img/browsers/firefox.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Firefox** provides strong privacy settings such as [Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop), which can help block various [types of tracking](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks).

        - [:simple-flathub: Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.mozilla.firefox)

!!! warning
    Firefox includes a unique [download token](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677497#c0) in downloads from Mozilla's website and uses telemetry in Firefox to send the token. The token is **not** included in releases from the [Mozilla FTP](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/).

### Rekommenderad konfiguration

These options can be found in :material-menu: → **Settings**

#### Search

- [ ] Uncheck **Provide search suggestions**

Search suggestion features may not be available in your region.

Search suggestions send everything you type in the address bar to the default search engine, regardless of whether you submit an actual search. Disabling search suggestions allows you to more precisely control what data you send to your search engine provider.

#### Privacy & Security

##### Enhanced Tracking Protection

- [x] Select **Strict** Enhanced Tracking Protection

This protects you by blocking social media trackers, fingerprinting scripts (note that this does not protect you from *all* fingerprinting), cryptominers, cross-site tracking cookies, and some other tracking content. ETP protects against many common threats, but it does not block all tracking avenues because it is designed to have minimal to no impact on site usability.

##### Firefox Suggest (US only)

[Firefox Suggest](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-suggest) is a feature similar to search suggestions which is only available in the US. We recommend disabling it for the same reason we recommend disabling search suggestions. If you don't see these options under the **Address Bar** header, you do not have the new experience and can ignore these changes.

- [ ] Uncheck **Suggestions from the web**
- [ ] Uncheck **Suggestions from sponsors**

##### Sanitize on Close

If you want to stay logged in to particular sites, you can allow exceptions in **Cookies and Site Data** → **Manage Exceptions...**

- [x] Check **Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed**

This protects you from persistent cookies, but does not protect you against cookies acquired during any one browsing session. When this is enabled, it becomes possible to easily cleanse your browser cookies by simply restarting Firefox. You can set exceptions on a per-site basis, if you wish to stay logged in to a particular site you visit often.

##### Telemetry

- [ ] Uncheck **Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla**
- [ ] Uncheck **Allow Firefox to install and run studies**
- [ ] Uncheck **Allow Firefox to send backlogged crash reports on your behalf**

> Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us. When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

Additionally, the Firefox Accounts service collects [some technical data](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#firefox-accounts). If you use a Firefox Account you can opt-out:

1. Open your [profile settings on accounts.firefox.com](https://accounts.firefox.com/settings#data-collection)
2. Uncheck **Data Collection and Use** > **Help improve Firefox Accounts**

##### HTTPS-Only Mode

- [x] Select **Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows**

This prevents you from unintentionally connecting to a website in plain-text HTTP. Sites without HTTPS are uncommon nowadays, so this should have little to no impact on your day to day browsing.

#### Sync

[Firefox Sync](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/) allows your browsing data (history, bookmarks, etc.) to be accessible on all your devices and protects it with E2EE.

### Arkenfox (advanced)

!!! tip "Use Mullvad Browser for advanced anti-fingerprinting"

    [Mullvad Browser](#mullvad-browser) provides the same anti-fingerprinting protections as Arkenfox out of the box, and does not require the use of Mullvad's VPN to benefit from these protections. Coupled with a VPN, Mullvad Browser can thwart more advanced tracking scripts which Arkenfox cannot. Arkenfox still has the advantage of being much more flexible, and allowing per-site exceptions for websites which you need to stay logged in to.

The [Arkenfox project](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) provides a set of carefully considered options for Firefox. If you [decide](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/1.1-To-Arkenfox-or-Not) to use Arkenfox, a [few options](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.2-Overrides-[Common]) are subjectively strict and/or may cause some websites to not work properly - [which you can easily change](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.1-Overrides) to suit your needs. We **strongly recommend** reading through their full [wiki](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki). Arkenfox also enables [container](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers#w_for-advanced-users) support.

Arkenfox only aims to thwart basic or naive tracking scripts through canvas randomization and Firefox's built-in fingerprint resistance configuration settings. It does not aim to make your browser blend in with a large crowd of other Arkenfox users in the same way Mullvad Browser or Tor Browser do, which is the only way to thwart advanced fingerprint tracking scripts. Remember you can always use multiple browsers, for example, you could consider using Firefox+Arkenfox for a few sites that you want to stay logged in on or otherwise trust, and Mullvad Browser for general browsing.

## Brave

!!! recommendation

    ![Brave logo](assets/img/browsers/brave.svg){ align=right }
    
    **Brave Browser** innehåller en inbyggd innehållsblockerare och [integritetsfunktioner] (https://brave.com/privacy-features/), varav många är aktiverade som standard.
    
    Brave bygger på webbläsarprojektet Chromium, så den bör kännas bekant och ha minimala problem med webbkompatibilitet.

        - [:simple-apple: macOS](https://brave.com/download/)
        - [:simple-linux: Linux](https://brave.com/linux/) (1)

    1. We advise against using the Flatpak version of Brave, as it replaces Chromium's sandbox with Flatpak's, which is less effective. Additionally, the package is not maintained by Brave Software, Inc.

### Rekommenderad konfiguration

These options can be found in :material-menu: → **Settings**.

#### Settings

##### Sköldar

Brave har några åtgärder mot fingeravtryck i sin funktion [Shields](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022973471-What-is-Shields-). Vi föreslår att du konfigurerar dessa alternativ [globalt](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023646212-How-do-I-configure-global-and-site-specific-Shields-settings-) på alla sidor som du besöker.

Shields alternativ kan nedgraderas vid behov för varje enskild plats, men som standard rekommenderar vi att du ställer in följande:

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- [x] Select **Prevent sites from fingerprinting me based on my language preferences**
- [x] Select **Aggressive** under Trackers & ads blocking

    ??? varning "Use default filter lists"
        Brave låter dig välja ytterligare innehållsfilter på den interna sidan `brave://adblock`. Vi avråder från att använda den här funktionen; behåll istället standardfilterlistorna. Om du använder extra listor sticker du ut från andra Brave-användare och kan också öka angreppsytan om det finns en exploit i Brave och en skadlig regel läggs till i en av de listor du använder.

- [x] Select **Strict** under **Upgrade connections to HTTPS**
- [x] (Optional) Select **Block Scripts** (1)
- [x] Select **Strict, may break sites** under Block fingerprinting

</div>

1. This option provides functionality similar to uBlock Origin's advanced [blocking modes](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) or the [NoScript](https://noscript.net/) extension.

##### Social media blocking

- [ ] Avmarkera alla komponenter för sociala medier

##### Privacy and security

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- [x] Select **Disable non-proxied UDP** under [WebRTC IP Handling Policy](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017989132-How-do-I-change-my-Privacy-Settings-#webrtc)
- [ ] Uncheck **Use Google services for push messaging**
- [ ] Uncheck **Allow privacy-preserving product analytics (P3A)**
- [ ] Uncheck **Automatically send daily usage ping to Brave**
- [ ] Uncheck **Automatically send diagnostic reports**
- [ ] Uncheck **Private window with Tor** (1)

    !!! tip "Sanitizing on Close"

        - [x] Select **Clear cookies and site data when you close all windows** in the *Cookies and other site data* menu

        If you wish to stay logged in to a particular site you visit often, you can set exceptions on a per-site basis under the *Customized behaviors* section.

</div>

1. Brave is **not** as resistant to fingerprinting as the Tor Browser and far fewer people use Brave with Tor, so you will stand out. Where [strong anonymity is required](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-What-is-a-Private-Window-with-Tor-Connectivity-) use the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser).

##### Extensions

Disable built-in extensions you do not use in **Extensions**

- [ ] Uncheck **Hangouts**
- [ ] Uncheck **WebTorrent**

##### Web3

Brave's Web3 features can potentially add to your browser fingerprint and attack surface. Unless you use any of features, they should be disabled.

- Select **Extensions (no fallback)** under Default Ethereum wallet and Default Solana wallet
- Set **Method to resolve IPFS resources** to **Disabled**

##### System

<div class="annotate" markdown>

- [ ] Uncheck **Continue running apps when Brave is closed** to disable background apps (1)

</div>

1. This option is not present on all platforms.

#### Sync

[Brave Sync](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059793111-Understanding-Brave-Sync) gör det möjligt att få tillgång till dina webbläsardata (historik, bokmärken osv.) på alla dina enheter utan att du behöver ett konto och skyddar dem med E2EE.

#### Brave Rewards and Wallet

**Brave Rewards** lets you recieve Basic Attention Token (BAT) cryptocurrency for performing certain actions within Brave. It relies on a custodial account and KYC from a select number of providers. We do not recommend BAT as a [private cryptocurrency](cryptocurrency.md), nor do we recommend using a [custodial wallet](advanced/payments.md#other-coins-bitcoin-ethereum-etc), so we would discourage using this feature.

**Brave Wallet** operates locally on your computer, but does not support any private cryptocurrencies, so we would discourage using this feature as well.

## Ytterligare resurser

In general, we recommend keeping your browser extensions to a minimum to decrease your attack surface; they have privileged access within your browser, require you to trust the developer, can make you [stand out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_fingerprint), and [weaken](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions/c/0ei-UCHNm34/m/lDaXwQhzBAAJ) site isolation. However, uBlock Origin may prove useful if you value content blocking functionality.

### uBlock Origin

!!! recommendation

    ![uBlock Origin logo](assets/img/browsers/ublock_origin.svg){ align=right }
    
    **uBlock Origin** is a popular content blocker that could help you block ads, trackers, and fingerprinting scripts.

We suggest following the [developer's documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode) and picking one of the "modes". Additional filter lists can impact performance and [may increase attack surface](https://portswigger.net/research/ublock-i-exfiltrate-exploiting-ad-blockers-with-css).

##### Other lists

These are some other [filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists) that you may want to consider adding:

- [x] Check **Privacy** > **AdGuard URL Tracking Protection**
- Add [Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt)

## Kriterier

**Observera att vi inte är knutna till något av de projekt som vi rekommenderar.** Förutom [våra standardkriterier](about/criteria.md)har vi utvecklat en tydlig uppsättning krav som gör det möjligt för oss att ge objektiva rekommendationer. Vi föreslår att du bekantar dig med den här listan innan du väljer att använda ett projekt, och att du gör din egen forskning för att se till att det är rätt val för dig.

!!! exempel "Det här avsnittet är nytt"

    Vi arbetar med att fastställa kriterier för varje del av vår webbplats, och detta kan komma att ändras. Om du har några frågor om våra kriterier, vänligen [fråga på vårt forum] (https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) och tro inte att vi inte har beaktat något när vi gjorde våra rekommendationer om det inte finns med här. Det finns många faktorer som beaktas och diskuteras när vi rekommenderar ett projekt, och att dokumentera varje enskild faktor är ett pågående arbete.

### Minimikrav

- Måste vara programvara med öppen källkod.
- Supports automatic updates.
- Receives engine updates in 0-1 days from upstream release.
- Available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Eventuella ändringar som krävs för att göra webbläsaren mer integritetsvänlig bör inte påverka användarupplevelsen negativt.
- Blocks third-party cookies by default.
- Supports [state partitioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning) to mitigate cross-site tracking.[^1]

### Bästa fall

Våra kriterier för bästa fall representerar vad vi skulle vilja se av det perfekta projektet i denna kategori. Våra rekommendationer kanske inte innehåller alla eller några av dessa funktioner, men de som gör det kan vara högre rankade än andra på den här sidan.

- Includes built-in content blocking functionality.
- Supports cookie compartmentalization (à la [Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers)).
- Supports Progressive Web Apps.  
  PWAs enable you to install certain websites as if they were native apps on your computer. This can have advantages over installing Electron-based apps, because you benefit from your browser's regular security updates.
- Does not include add-on functionality (bloatware) that does not impact user privacy.
- Does not collect telemetry by default.
- Provides open-source sync server implementation.
- Defaults to a [private search engine](search-engines.md).

### Kriterier för förlängning

- Får inte replikera inbyggda webbläsar- eller OS-funktioner.
- Måste direkt påverka användarens integritet, det vill säga får inte bara ge information.
