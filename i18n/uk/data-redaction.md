    **MAT2** is free software, which allows the metadata to be removed from image, audio, torrent, and document file types. It provides both a command line tool and a graphical user interface via an [extension for Nautilus](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/-/tree/master/nautilus), the default file manager of [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org), and [Dolphin](https://0xacab.org/jvoisin/mat2/-/tree/master/dolphin), the default file manager of [KDE](https://kde.org).
    
    On Linux, a third-party graphical tool [Metadata Cleaner](https://gitlab.com/rmnvgr/metadata-cleaner) powered by MAT2 exists and is [available on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/fr.romainvigier.MetadataCleaner).

    ![ExifEraser logo](assets/img/data-redaction/exiferaser.svg){ align=right }
    
    **ExifEraser** is a modern, permissionless image metadata erasing application for Android.
    
    It currently supports JPEG, PNG and WebP files.

        - [:simple-github: GitHub](https://github.com/Tommy-Geenexus/exif-eraser/releases)

The metadata that is erased depends on the image's file type:

* **JPEG**: ICC Profile, Exif, Photoshop Image Resources and XMP/ExtendedXMP metadata will be erased if it exists.
* **PNG**: ICC Profile, Exif and XMP metadata will be erased if it exists.
* **WebP**: ICC Profile, Exif and XMP metadata will be erased if it exists.

After processing the images, ExifEraser provides you with a full report about what exactly was removed from each image.

The app offers multiple ways to erase metadata from images. Namely:

* You can share an image from another application with ExifEraser.
* Through the app itself, you can select a single image, multiple images at once, or even an entire directory.
* It features a "Camera" option, which uses your operating system's camera app to take a photo, and then it removes the metadata from it.
* It allows you to drag photos from another app into ExifEraser when they are both open in split-screen mode.
* Lastly, it allows you to paste an image from your clipboard.

!!! warning

    You should **never** use blur to redact [text in images](https://bishopfox.com/blog/unredacter-tool-never-pixelation). If you want to redact text in an image, draw a box over the text. For this, we suggest apps like [Pocket Paint](https://github.com/Catrobat/Paintroid).

## Criteria

**Please note we are not affiliated with any of the projects we recommend.** In addition to [our standard criteria](about/criteria.md), we have developed a clear set of requirements to allow us to provide objective recommendations. We suggest you familiarize yourself with this list before choosing to use a project, and conduct your own research to ensure it's the right choice for you.

    We are working on establishing defined criteria for every section of our site, and this may be subject to change. If you have any questions about our criteria, please [ask on our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/latest) and don't assume we didn't consider something when making our recommendations if it is not listed here. There are many factors considered and discussed when we recommend a project, and documenting every single one is a work-in-progress.

- Apps developed for open-source operating systems must be open-source.
- Apps must be free and should not include ads or other limitations.
