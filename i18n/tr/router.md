**OPNsense** is an open-source, FreeBSD-based firewall and routing platform which incorporates many advanced features such as traffic shaping, load balancing, and VPN capabilities, with many more features available in the form of plugins. Bir ağ için özel bir güvenlik duvarı/yönlendirici yapmak üzere bir bilgisayara kurulmuştur ve güvenilirliği, genellikle, sadece pahalı ticari güvenlik duvarlarında bulunan özellikler sunmasıyla bilinir.

OPNsense was originally developed as a fork of [pfSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense), and both projects are noted for being free and reliable firewall distributions which offer features often only found in expensive commercial firewalls. Launched in 2015, the developers of OPNsense [cited](https://docs.opnsense.org/history/thefork.html) a number of security and code-quality issues with pfSense which they felt necessitated a fork of the project, as well as concerns about Netgate's majority acquisition of pfSense and the future direction of the pfSense project.
