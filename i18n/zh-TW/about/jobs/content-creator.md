感謝您對 Privacy Guides 的這個職位感興趣。 目前我們不再接受新的申請，但請追蹤我們的[職缺](../jobs.md)頁面以了解未來的工作機會。

</div>

您對隱私權與網路安全充滿熱忱嗎？

Privacy Guides 是一個國際性非營利組織，致力於製作頂尖且公正的教育內容與新聞報導，並培育安全且具資訊價值的線上社群，以探討提升個人隱私與網路安全相關技術議題。

Privacy Guides 正在尋找一位專注且積極進取的人才，負責我們社交媒體的完整經營，特別著重於影音內容的開發。 若想勝任此職位，您必須能自在面對鏡頭。

這是千載難逢的機會。 您的首要目標將是製作並分享基於隱私的教育材料，且不帶有任何銷售產品的動機。 If you truly value being able to create the best content that you can, and if you are passionate about privacy, then this position is for you!

Your responsibilities will include, but aren’t limited to:

- Scripting and hosting educational video content to be posted across various social media platforms.
- Video editing, production, and other backend work required to make successful content.
- Researching new topics to cover.
- Regular, daily posting to text-based social media platforms like Mastodon.
- Regular posting of highly educational video content to social media platforms.
- Compiling news sources for and hosting a weekly news recap (livestreamed) podcast on our YouTube channel.
- Regularly communicating with the Privacy Guides committee and other team members.

This is a highly individualized role, and we are extremely interested in hearing your ideas on how you’ll find success and make this role your own. You will be responsible for handling virtually every aspect of this role without regular supervision, so being highly self-motivated is a must.

As a guideline, we expect your video output to be roughly 1 video and 1 _This Week In Privacy_ livestream per week, since we think most videos which meet our quality standards will be a multi-day process to research and script, in addition to a day for recording and editing. We realize some videos can be completed more quickly, while others may take multiple weeks or longer before publishing. You will be empowered to use your best judgement and prioritize your work accordingly.

Job requirements:

- Excellent organization and communication skills.
- Flexibility to set and respond to varying priorities and deadlines.
- Proactive, results-driven mindset with a strong sense of initiative.
- Comfortable being on camera, and working with video production equipment.
- Personal interest in consumer privacy, cybersecurity, and technology.
- Skeptical nature and drive to investigate difficult, often niche, technologies. You will need to evaluate the truthfulness of claims.

The following qualifications will be an asset to your application. However, we are looking for the best candidate (which isn’t always apparent on paper!), so please apply even if you don’t meet any/many of these qualifications.

- Previous YouTube or other video creation experience.
- Previous social media management experience.
- Education in English, journalism, media production, or any other related fields.
- Fluency in Spanish, French, Portuguese, or other languages.
- Familiarity with Privacy Guides' communities, culture, and mission.
- A solid understanding of the latest trends/culture on YouTube & TikTok.
- Located between UTC-08:00 and UTC-04:00 time zones.
- At least basic familiarity with GitHub, including pull requests, branches, reviews, and issues.

The ideal candidate can commit to this role on a full-time basis (40 hours / week), but we are open to discussing a schedule you suggest.

For this position, our hiring pay range falls between \$20-$25 / hour USD. The base pay may vary depending on job related qualifications such as knowledge, skills, and experience. Our compensation structure is rooted in a performance and merit based approach that acknowledges performance of both the individual and the project as a whole.
