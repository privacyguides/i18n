If you're looking for additional *privacy* from your ISP, on a public Wi-Fi network, or while torrenting files, a **VPN** may be the solution for you.

<div class="admonition danger" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">VPNs do not provide anonymity</p>

Using a VPN will **not** keep your browsing habits anonymous, nor will it add additional security to non-secure (HTTP) traffic.

If you are looking for **anonymity**, you should use the Tor Browser. If you're looking for added **security**, you should always ensure you're connecting to websites using HTTPS. VPN不是良好安全实践的替代品。

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } 112 Countries

Proton VPN has [servers in 112 countries](https://protonvpn.com/vpn-servers) or [5](https://protonvpn.com/support/how-to-create-free-vpn-account) if you use their [free plan](https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn/server).(1) Picking a VPN provider with a server nearest to you will reduce latency of the network traffic you send. 这是因为到达目的地的路由较短(跳数较少)。
{ .annotate }

1. Last checked: 2024-08-06

We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use [dedicated servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service), instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as [virtual private servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Independently Audited

截至2020年1月，Proton VPN已经接受了SEC咨询公司的独立审计。 SEC Consult在Proton VPN的Windows、Android和iOS应用程序中发现了一些中度和低度风险的漏洞，在报告发布前，Proton VPN都已经 "妥善修复"。 所发现的问题中没有任何一个能让攻击者远程访问你的设备或流量。 You can view individual reports for each platform at [protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com/blog/open-source). In April 2022 Proton VPN underwent [another audit](https://protonvpn.com/blog/no-logs-audit). A [letter of attestation](https://proton.me/blog/security-audit-all-proton-apps) was provided for Proton VPN's apps on 9th November 2021 by [Securitum](https://research.securitum.com).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Open-Source Clients

Proton VPN provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ProtonVPN).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Accepts Cash

Proton VPN, in addition to accepting credit/debit cards, PayPal, and [Bitcoin](advanced/payments.md#other-coins-bitcoin-ethereum-etc), also accepts **cash/local currency** as an anonymous form of payment.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } WireGuard Support

Proton VPN主要支持WireGuard®协议。 [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) is a newer protocol that uses state-of-the-art [cryptography](https://wireguard.com/protocol). 此外， WireGuard旨在更简单、更高效。

Proton VPN [recommends](https://protonvpn.com/blog/wireguard) the use of WireGuard with their service. On Proton VPN's Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, ChromeOS, and Android TV apps, WireGuard is the default protocol; however, [support](https://protonvpn.com/support/how-to-change-vpn-protocols) for the protocol is not present in their Linux app.

#### :material-alert-outline:{ .pg-orange } No IPv6 Support

Proton VPN's servers are only compatible with IPv4. The Proton VPN applications will block all outgoing IPv6 traffic, so you don't have to worry about your IPv6 address being leaked, but you will not be able to connect to any IPv6-only sites, and you will not be able to connect to Proton VPN from an IPv6-only network.

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-info } Remote Port Forwarding

Proton VPN currently only supports ephemeral remote [port forwarding](https://protonvpn.com/support/port-forwarding) via NAT-PMP, with 60 second lease times. The Windows app provides an easy to access option for it, while on other operating systems you'll need to run your own [NAT-PMP client](https://protonvpn.com/support/port-forwarding-manual-setup). Torrent applications often support NAT-PMP natively.

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-blue } Anti-Censorship

Proton VPN has their [Stealth](https://protonvpn.com/blog/stealth-vpn-protocol) protocol which *may* help in situations where VPN protocols like OpenVPN or Wireguard are blocked with various rudimentary techniques. Stealth encapsulates the VPN tunnel in TLS session in order to look like more generic internet traffic.

Unfortunately, it does not work very well in countries where sophisticated filters that analyze all outgoing traffic in an attempt to discover encrypted tunnels are deployed. Stealth is available on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, but it's not yet available on Linux.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Mobile Clients

In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, Proton VPN has mobile clients for [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1437005085), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.protonvpn.android), and [GitHub](https://github.com/ProtonVPN/android-app/releases) allowing for easy connections to their servers.

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-blue } Additional Notes

Proton VPN clients support two factor authentication on all platforms. Proton VPN has their own servers and datacenters in Switzerland, Iceland and Sweden. They offer content blocking and known-malware blocking with their DNS service. Additionally, Proton VPN also offers "Tor" servers allowing you to easily connect to onion sites, but we still strongly recommend using [the official Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) for this purpose.

##### :material-alert-outline:{ .pg-orange } Killswitch feature is broken on Intel-based Macs

System crashes [may occur](https://protonvpn.com/support/macos-t2-chip-kill-switch) on Intel-based Macs when using the VPN killswitch. If you require this feature, and you are using a Mac with Intel chipset, you should consider using another VPN service.

### IVPN

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![IVPN标志](assets/img/vpn/ivpn.svg){ align=right }

**IVPN**是另一个高级VPN供应商，他们自2009年以来一直在运营。 IVPN is based in Gibraltar and does not offer a free trial.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Independently Audited

IVPN has undergone a [no-logging audit from Cure53](https://cure53.de/audit-report_ivpn.pdf) which concluded in agreement with IVPN's no-logging claim. IVPN has also completed a [comprehensive pentest report Cure53](https://cure53.de/summary-report_ivpn_2019.pdf) in January 2020. IVPN has also said they plan to have [annual reports](https://ivpn.net/blog/independent-security-audit-concluded) in the future. A further review was conducted [in April 2022](https://ivpn.net/blog/ivpn-apps-security-audit-2022-concluded) and was produced by Cure53 [on their website](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_IVPN_2022.pdf).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Open-Source Clients

As of February 2020 [IVPN applications are now open source](https://ivpn.net/blog/ivpn-applications-are-now-open-source). Source code can be obtained from their [GitHub organization](https://github.com/ivpn).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Accepts Cash and Monero

In addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, IVPN accepts Bitcoin, **Monero** and **cash/local currency** (on annual plans) as anonymous forms of payment. Prepaid cards with redeem codes are [also available](https://ivpn.net/knowledgebase/billing/voucher-cards-faq).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } WireGuard Support

IVPN supports the WireGuard® protocol. [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) is a newer protocol that uses state-of-the-art [cryptography](https://wireguard.com/protocol). 此外， WireGuard旨在更简单、更高效。

IVPN [recommends](https://ivpn.net/wireguard) the use of WireGuard with their service and, as such, the protocol is the default on all of IVPN's apps. IVPN also offers a WireGuard configuration generator for use with the official WireGuard [apps](https://wireguard.com/install).

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-blue } IPv6 Support

IVPN allows you to [connect to services using IPv6](https://ivpn.net/knowledgebase/general/do-you-support-ipv6) but doesn't allow you to connect from a device using an IPv6 address.

#### :material-alert-outline:{ .pg-orange } Remote Port Forwarding

IVPN previously supported port forwarding, but removed the option in [June 2023](https://ivpn.net/blog/gradual-removal-of-port-forwarding). Missing this feature could negatively impact certain applications, especially peer-to-peer applications like torrent clients.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Anti-Censorship

IVPN has obfuscation modes using the [v2ray](https://v2ray.com/en/index.html) project which helps in situations where VPN protocols like OpenVPN or Wireguard are blocked. Currently this feature is only available on Desktop and [iOS](https://ivpn.net/knowledgebase/ios/v2ray). It has two modes where it can use [VMess](https://guide.v2fly.org/en_US/basics/vmess.html) over QUIC or TCP connections. QUIC is a modern protocol with better congestion control and therefore may be faster with reduced latency. The TCP mode makes your data appear as regular HTTP traffic.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Mobile Clients

In addition to providing standard OpenVPN configuration files, IVPN has mobile clients for [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1193122683), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ivpn.client), and [GitHub](https://github.com/ivpn/android-app/releases) allowing for easy connections to their servers.

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-blue } Additional Notes

IVPN clients support two factor authentication. IVPN also provides "[AntiTracker](https://ivpn.net/antitracker)" functionality, which blocks advertising networks and trackers from the network level.

### Mullvad

<div class="admonition recommendation" markdown>

![Mullvad logo](assets/img/vpn/mullvad.svg){ align=right }

**Mullvad** is a fast and inexpensive VPN with a serious focus on transparency and security. They have been in operation since 2009. Mullvad is based in Sweden and does not offer a free trial.

We also think it's better for the security of the VPN provider's private keys if they use [dedicated servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_hosting_service), instead of cheaper shared solutions (with other customers) such as [virtual private servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Independently Audited

Mullvad's VPN clients have been audited by Cure53 and Assured AB in a pentest report [published at cure53.de](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_v2.pdf). The security researchers concluded:

> Cure53 and Assured AB are happy with the results of the audit and the software leaves an overall positive impression. With security dedication of the in-house team at the Mullvad VPN compound, the testers have no doubts about the project being on the right track from a security standpoint.

In 2020 a second audit [was announced](https://mullvad.net/blog/2020/6/25/results-available-audit-mullvad-app) and the [final audit report](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2020_v2.pdf) was made available on Cure53's website:

> The results of this May-June 2020 project targeting the Mullvad complex are quite positive. [...] The overall application ecosystem used by Mullvad leaves a sound and structured impression. The overall structure of the application makes it easy to roll out patches and fixes in a structured manner. More than anything, the findings spotted by Cure53 showcase the importance of constantly auditing and re-assessing the current leak vectors, in order to always ensure privacy of the end-users. With that being said, Mullvad does a great job protecting the end-user from common PII leaks and privacy related risks.

In 2021 an infrastructure audit [was announced](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2021/1/20/no-pii-or-privacy-leaks-found-cure53s-infrastructure-audit) and the [final audit report](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_mullvad_2021_v1.pdf) was made available on Cure53's website. Another report was commissioned [in June 2022](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2022/6/22/vpn-server-audit-found-no-information-leakage-or-logging-of-customer-data) and is available on [Assured's website](https://assured.se/publications/Assured_Mullvad_relay_server_audit_report_2022.pdf).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Open-Source Clients

Mullvad provides the source code for their desktop and mobile clients in their [GitHub organization](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Accepts Cash and Monero

Mullvad, in addition to accepting credit/debit cards and PayPal, accepts Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, **Monero** and **cash/local currency** as anonymous forms of payment. Prepaid cards with redeem codes are also available. Mullvad also accepts Swish and bank wire transfers.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } WireGuard Support

Mullvad supports the WireGuard® protocol. [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com) is a newer protocol that uses state-of-the-art [cryptography](https://wireguard.com/protocol). 此外， WireGuard旨在更简单、更高效。

Mullvad [recommends](https://mullvad.net/en/help/why-wireguard) the use of WireGuard with their service. It is the default or only protocol on Mullvad's Android, iOS, macOS, and Linux apps, but on Windows you have to [manually enable](https://mullvad.net/en/help/how-turn-wireguard-mullvad-app) WireGuard. Mullvad also offers a WireGuard configuration generator for use with the official WireGuard [apps](https://wireguard.com/install).

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } IPv6 Support

Mullvad allows you to [access services hosted on IPv6](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2014/9/15/ipv6-support) and connect from a device using an IPv6 address.

#### :material-alert-outline:{ .pg-orange } Remote Port Forwarding

Mullvad previously supported port forwarding, but removed the option in [May 2023](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/5/29/removing-the-support-for-forwarded-ports). Missing this feature could negatively impact certain applications, especially peer-to-peer applications like torrent clients.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Anti-Censorship

Mullvad has obfuscation an mode using [Shadowsocks with v2ray](https://mullvad.net/en/help/shadowsocks-with-v2ray) which may be useful in situations where VPN protocols like OpenVPN or Wireguard are blocked.

#### :material-check:{ .pg-green } Mobile Clients

Mullvad has published [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1488466513) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn) clients, both supporting an easy-to-use interface as opposed to requiring you to manually configure your WireGuard connection. The Android client is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases).

#### :material-information-outline:{ .pg-blue } Additional Notes

Mullvad is very transparent about which nodes they [own or rent](https://mullvad.net/en/servers). They use [ShadowSocks](https://shadowsocks.org) in their ShadowSocks + OpenVPN configuration, making them more resistant against firewalls with [Deep Packet Inspection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection) trying to block VPNs. Supposedly, [China has to use a different method to block ShadowSocks servers](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/22).

## Criteria

<div class="admonition danger" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>

值得注意的是，使用VPN供应商不会使你成为匿名者，但在某些情况下会给你更好的隐私。 VPN不是非法活动的工具。 不要依赖 "无日志 "政策。

</div>

**请注意，我们与我们推荐的任何供应商都没有关系。 这使我们能够提供完全客观的建议。** 除了 [我们的标准标准](about/criteria.md)，我们还为任何希望被推荐的VPN供应商制定了一套明确的要求，包括强大的加密、独立的安全审计、现代技术等。 我们建议你在选择VPN供应商之前熟悉这份清单，并进行自己的研究，以确保你选择的VPN供应商尽可能值得信赖。

### 技术

我们要求所有我们推荐的VPN供应商提供OpenVPN配置文件，以便在任何客户端使用。 **如果** 一个VPN提供他们自己的定制客户端，我们需要一个killswitch来阻止断开连接时的网络数据泄露。

**符合条件的最低要求。**

- 支持强大的协议，如WireGuard & OpenVPN。
- 客户端内置的杀毒软件。
- 多跳支持。 多重跳转对于在单个节点受损的情况下保持数据的私密性非常重要。
- If VPN clients are provided, they should be [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), like the VPN software they generally have built into them. 我们相信， [源代码](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) 的可用性提供了更大的透明度，了解你的设备实际上在做什么。

**Best Case:**

- 具有高度可配置的选项（在某些网络上启用/禁用，在启动时，等等）的杀戮开关。
- 易于使用的VPN客户端
- 支持 [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)。 我们希望服务器将允许通过IPv6的传入连接，并允许你访问IPv6地址上托管的服务。
- [远程端口转发的能力](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding#Remote_port_forwarding) 在使用P2P ([Peer-to-Peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)) 文件共享软件或托管服务器（如Mumble）时，有助于创建连接。
- Obfuscation technology which pads data packets with random data to circumvent internet censorship.

### 隐私

We prefer our recommended providers to collect as little data as possible. 不在注册时收集个人信息，并接受匿名的支付方式，这是必须的。

**符合条件的最低要求。**

- [Anonymous cryptocurrency](cryptocurrency.md) **or** cash payment option.
- 注册时不需要提供个人信息。最多只有用户名、密码和电子邮件。

**Best Case:**

- Accepts multiple [anonymous payment options](advanced/payments.md).
- No personal information accepted (autogenerated username, no email required, etc.).

### 安全性

A VPN is pointless if it can't even provide adequate security. We require all our recommended providers to abide by current security standards for their OpenVPN connections. Ideally, they would use more future-proof encryption schemes by default. We also require an independent third-party to audit the provider's security, ideally in a very comprehensive manner and on a repeated (yearly) basis.

**符合条件的最低要求。**

- Strong Encryption Schemes: OpenVPN with SHA-256 authentication; RSA-2048 or better handshake; AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CBC data encryption.
- Forward Secrecy.
- Published security audits from a reputable third-party firm.

**Best Case:**

- Strongest Encryption: RSA-4096.
- Forward Secrecy.
- Comprehensive published security audits from a reputable third-party firm.
- Bug-bounty programs and/or a coordinated vulnerability-disclosure process.

### Trust

You wouldn't trust your finances to someone with a fake identity, so why trust them with your internet data? We require our recommended providers to be public about their ownership or leadership. We also would like to see frequent transparency reports, especially in regard to how government requests are handled.

**符合条件的最低要求。**

- Public-facing leadership or ownership.

**Best Case:**

- Public-facing leadership.
- Frequent transparency reports.

### Marketing

With the VPN providers we recommend we like to see responsible marketing.

**符合条件的最低要求。**

- Must self-host analytics (i.e., no Google Analytics). The provider's site must also comply with [DNT (Do Not Track)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) for people who want to opt-out.

Must not have any marketing which is irresponsible:

- Making guarantees of protecting anonymity 100%. When someone makes a claim that something is 100% it means there is no certainty for failure. We know people can quite easily deanonymize themselves in a number of ways, e.g.:
    - Reusing personal information (e.g., email accounts, unique pseudonyms, etc.) that they accessed without anonymity software (Tor, VPN, etc.)
    - [Browser fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint#Browser_fingerprint)
- Claim that a single circuit VPN is "more anonymous" than Tor, which is a circuit of three or more hops that regularly changes.
- Use responsible language: i.e., it is okay to say that a VPN is "disconnected" or "not connected", however claiming that someone is "exposed", "vulnerable" or "compromised" is needless use of alarming language that may be incorrect. For example, that person might simply be on another VPN provider's service or using Tor.

**Best Case:**

Responsible marketing that is both educational and useful to the consumer could include:

- An accurate comparison to when [Tor](tor.md) should be used instead.
- Availability of the VPN provider's website over a [.onion service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion)

### Additional Functionality

While not strictly requirements, there are some factors we looked into when determining which providers to recommend. These include content blocking functionality, warrant canaries, multihop connections, excellent customer support, the number of allowed simultaneous connections, etc.
