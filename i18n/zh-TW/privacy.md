### Privacy Guides 會蒐集瀏覽其網站的相關資訊

當您造訪我們的網站時，不管您是否有帳號，我們都會使用伺服器紀錄檔與其他方法來蒐集關於您造訪哪些頁面以及造訪時間的資料。

我們使用這些資料來：

### Privacy Guides 蒐集帳號資料

我們論壇上的許多功能或其他以帳號為基礎的服務都需要帳號。 舉例來說，您必須擁有帳號才能張貼與回覆主題。

要註冊帳號，Privacy Guides 需要您的電子郵件地址、使用者名稱與密碼。

Privacy Guides stores this account data as long as your account remains open.

### Privacy Guides collects data about posts and other activity

Privacy Guides collects the content of your posts throughout our websites, plus data about bookmarks, likes, and links you follow in order to share that data with others. We also publish this activity to the public when you request it.

Privacy Guides also collects data about private messages that you send through the forum. Privacy Guides makes private messages available to senders and their recipients, and also to forum moderators and administrators.

Privacy Guides stores your posts and other activity as long as your account remains open.

### Privacy Guides collects data you give to sign up for mailing lists and announcements

When you fill out and submit a web form to sign up for mailing lists or announcements, Privacy Guides collects the information you put in the form, such as your e-mail address.

Privacy Guides stores this information until you unsubscribe from the mailing list.

### Privacy Guides does not collect sensitive personal information

Privacy Guides does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as government identification numbers, information on racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, health data, or any of the special categories of personal data specified by the GDPR.

### Privacy Guides collects data about open source contributors

Contributors to Privacy Guides' website may be asked to provide identifying and contact information such as your name and email address.

Privacy Guides uses this information to maintain the integrity of our website, software, and license agreements, both our own licenses and the license between Privacy Guides and our contributors. Privacy Guides stores this information for as long as your contributions are incorporated into our open source software, including this website.

### Privacy Guides collects data when you donate to us

#### When you subscribe to a membership on privacyguides.org

When you donate to us through our [membership program](#/portal), we collect your email address. Your payment information is also collected by our payment processor Stripe in order to facilitate the transaction. You can also optionally provide your name, which is used to personalize your experience, and can be removed or changed in your [profile settings](#/portal/account/profile) at any time.

If your membership and newsletter subscription matches an email address associated with an account on our forum, we will link your membership status to your forum account. This allows you to receive special perks on the forum, such as a members-only title or flair, and access to members-only categories.

If the Member title or Member flair is enabled on your forum profile, Privacy Guides will share your username and profile picture on our websites for the purposes of acknowledging your donation to the project. You may revoke this consent at any time by removing the title and flair from your public profile, and we will no longer share your donation status publicly. This will not affect your access to members-only benefits. It may take until the next website release for your data to be removed from public visibility.

#### When you donate to us via GitHub Sponsors

When you donate to us on GitHub Sponsors, we collect your GitHub username and profile picture. Your payment information is also collected by our subprocessors GitHub and Stripe in order to facilitate the transaction.

If you choose to make your donation public during or after the checkout process on GitHub, Privacy Guides will share your username and profile picture on our websites for the purposes of fulfilling your request. You may revoke this consent at any time, and we will no longer share your donation status publicly. It may take until the next website release for your data to be removed from public visibility.

#### When you subscribe to a membership or donate to us on donate.magicgrants.org

When you donate to us on [donate.magicgrants.org](https://donate.magicgrants.org/privacyguides), a [separate privacy policy](https://donate.magicgrants.org/privacy) applies as noted at the beginning of this document.

However, if you optionally link your `donate.magicgrants.org` account to your Privacy Guides forum account, our forum collects some personal data which is covered by this notice: namely your forum username and whether you have an active membership.

We process that information in order to grant you special perks on the forum. Additionally, if you choose to make this status public by setting a members-only title or flair, we will share the status of your active membership on our websites. You may revoke this consent at any time by removing the title and flair from your public profile, and we will no longer share your donation status publicly. This will not affect your access to members-only benefits. It may take until the next website release for your data to be removed from public visibility.

This information is stored for as long as your membership is active, or until you unlink your forum and MAGIC Grants donation accounts in your profile settings.

### Privacy Guides collects data when you contact us

When you contact Privacy Guides via email, Signal, or any of our other contact methods, we collect the information you submit to us, and any identifying information associated with the account you use to contact us. For example, when you contact us via Signal we will collect your Signal profile information. When you contact us via email we will collect your email address, name, and mail server IP address.

In this case we limit the processing of any personal data you provide us to what is strictly necessary to communicate with you and organize our messages.

Privacy Guides stores this data for as long as we are in contact with you, or for up to 1 year after your last contact with us. You have the right to request all data related to your private communication with us be deleted at any time, and we will generally do so within 7 days.

### The Privacy Guides website stores local data

Our website uses Local Storage in your browser to store your color scheme preference. This data is only used by client-side JavaScript to change the color scheme of this website according to your preference.

Our website also uses Session Storage to cache the current version number of this website and the number of stars/forks of our GitHub repository. This data is fetched once per session from GitHub, and is only used by client-side JavaScript to display that information at the top of each page.

## Does Privacy Guides use personal information for marketing purposes?

Privacy Guides may use personal data about our users in order to directly promote our own resources, such as for sharing new resources or when fundraising. We also use the information you give us when signing up for our mailing lists and announcements to send those messages.

## Where does Privacy Guides store data about me?

Most data is hosted by [Triplebit](https://www.triplebit.org) web services in the United States.

Some publicly accessible data may be hosted by Content Delivery Networks with servers in other jurisdictions. For example, your profile picture may be stored on multiple servers around the world in order to improve the performance for visitors to our website.

## Does Privacy Guides comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation?

Privacy Guides respects rights under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Information that GDPR requires Privacy Guides to give can be found throughout this privacy notice, including information on the rights of data subjects.

### What are my rights under the GDPR?

The GDPR provides you with the following rights with respect to personal information about you that we collect or process:

- the right to [access](#where-can-i-access-data-about-me) your personal data
- the right to [rectification](#how-can-i-change-or-erase-data-about-me) of inaccurate or incomplete personal data
- the right to [erasure](#how-can-i-change-or-erase-data-about-me) of your personal data
- the right to [data portability](#where-can-i-access-data-about-me)
- the right to restrict the processing of your personal data

- the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

Information about how to exercise these rights is provided throughout this notice and linked above. We try to make exercising all of these rights easy to do on your own through your account settings, but for more complicated inquiries the best option will be to [contact](#how-can-i-contact-privacy-guides-about-privacy) us.

### What is the lawful basis for data collection and processing?

Privacy Guides generally processes your data using 3 of the 6 lawful bases for processing set out in Article 6 of the GDPR:

- **Consent**: When you give us clear consent for us to process your personal data. This consent can be easily withdrawn at any time in your account settings, or you may always contact us for assistance with privacy-related matters.
- **Contract**: When you give us your personal data in order to participate on services we operate according to our terms of service, or when we require personal data in order to take steps prior to entering a contract or to fulfill a contract.
- **Legitimate interest**: When we process your personal data for fraud prevention, network and information security, or other reasons where the processing is required for our own legitimate interests or for those of a third party we work with.

The lawful basis for our processing determines what rights are available to you under the GDPR. This table may be used as a reference:

### Does Privacy Guides make international data transfers?

Currently:

- Privacy Guides [processes personal data on servers outside the European Union](#where-does-privacy-guides-store-data-about-me).
- Privacy Guides uses [subprocessors](#subprocessors-used-by-privacy-guides) with personnel and computers outside the European Union.
- Privacy Guides has [personnel](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/u?group=team&order=solutions&period=all) in the United States, Australia, and other non-EU countries without EU adequacy decisions under GDPR. These people need access to forum personal data in order to keep forums running, address security concerns, respond to privacy-related requests from users, field technical support requests, and otherwise assist users.
- Privacy Guides is very likely subject to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the United States, a law that the European Court of Justice has found inadequately protects the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
- Privacy Guides has never received any order or request for personal data under FISA 702 or any similar national security or surveillance law of any other country. Privacy Guides is not subject to any court order or legal obligation that would prevent it from disclosing the existence or non-existence of such an order or request.
- Privacy Guides has a policy for how we will respond to those orders and requests, in case we ever receive one. Privacy Guides will suspend processing, notify any affected user, minimize disclosure, and resist disclosure of personal data, all as the law allows.

Because national security and surveillance laws may be in conflict with European data protection rules, Privacy Guides continually reassesses the practical reach of these laws to ensure our data transfers are adequately safeguarded.

## Does Privacy Guides comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act and other US state comprehensive privacy laws?

Privacy Guides is not a "business" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) or a “controller” directly subject to other US state comprehensive privacy laws.

Privacy Guides **never** sells your personal information.

## Where can I access data about me?

You can see your account data by visiting your profile page on any websites where we offer accounts. Your account profile will also list your posts and other activity on the website.

On the forum, your [profile settings](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/my/preferences/account) include a link to download all of your activity in standard Comma Separated Values format.

If you do not have an account with us but have a data access request, please [contact us](about.md).

## How can I change or erase data about me?

You can change your account data at any time by visiting the profile settings page for your account. You also have the option to delete your profile on the settings page of your account. Utilizing this option begins the process of erasing or anonymizing Privacy Guides' records of data you provided for your account. Forum administrators and moderators also have the option to erase and anonymize accounts.

You may also be able to edit, anonymize, or erase your posts. When you edit posts, Privacy Guides will keep all versions of your posts. These old versions of posts are not public, but may be accessed by forum moderators or administrators.

## Does Privacy Guides make automated decisions based on my data?

### The Privacy Guides forum classifies posts as spam automatically

We use data about your posts and other posts on many forums to make automated decisions about whether your posts to our websites are likely spam.

If you think a post has been wrongfully blocked or removed, please contact a forum moderator who can override this decision.

### The Privacy Guides forum uses data about your posts and activity to set trust levels

We use data about your posts and activity on our forum to award you badges and calculate a trust level for your account. Your trust level may affect how you can participate in the forum, such as whether you can upload images, as well as give you access to moderation and management powers in the forum. Your trust level therefore reflects forum administrators’ confidence in you, and their willingness to delegate community management functions, like moderation.

If you think your trust level has been set incorrectly, contact an administrator of your forum. They can manually adjust the trust level of your account.

### The Privacy Guides forum uses community flags to take automated actions

Your posts may be automatically hidden, or your ability to post may be automatically suspended, as a result of your posts being flagged by other users.

These decisions are later reviewed by moderators, who can override these decisions at their discretion.

## Does Privacy Guides share data about me with others?

Privacy Guides shares account data with others as described in [the section about account data](#privacy-guides-collects-account-data).

Privacy Guides shares data about your posts and other activity as described in [the section about forum data](#privacy-guides-collects-data-about-posts-and-other-activity-on-our-forum).

## Does Privacy Guides delete inactive accounts?

Privacy Guides deletes accounts that have no public activity when they have gone unused for 3 years. If the account has public activity, we will not delete it regardless of inactivity because your profile data is required to continue to publish your activity per your original request.

You can always request the deletion of your data at any time regardless of this policy.

## How can I contact Privacy Guides about privacy?

You can send questions, requests, and complaints via email to us at <team@privacyguides.org>. You may also use Signal or another contact method detailed [here](about.md#contact-us) to contact us more securely.

For complaints under GDPR more generally, you always have the option to lodge complaints with your local data protection supervisory authorities.
