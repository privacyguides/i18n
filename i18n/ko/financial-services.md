Making payments online is one of the biggest challenges to privacy. These services can assist you in protecting your privacy from merchants and other trackers, provided you have a strong understanding of how to make private payments effectively. We strongly encourage you first read our payments overview article before making any purchases:

[Making Private Payments :material-arrow-right-drop-circle:](advanced/payments.md ""){.md-button}

## Payment Masking Services

There are a number of services which provide "virtual debit cards" which you can use with online merchants without revealing your actual banking or billing information in most cases. It's important to note that these financial services are **not** anonymous and are subject to "Know Your Customer" (KYC) laws and may require your ID or other identifying information. These services are primarily useful for protecting you from merchant data breaches, less sophisticated tracking or purchase correlation by marketing agencies, and online data theft; and **not** for making a purchase completely anonymously.

Many banks and credit card providers offer native virtual card functionality. If you use one which provides this option already, you should use it over the following recommendations in most cases. That way you are not trusting multiple parties with your personal information.

### Privacy.com (US)

![Privacy.com logo](assets/img/financial-services/privacy_com-dark.svg#only-dark){ align=right }

**Privacy.com**'s free plan allows you to create up to 12 virtual cards per month, set spend limits on those cards, and shut off cards instantly. Their paid plan allows you to create up to 36 cards per month, get 1% cash back on purchases, and hide transaction information from your bank.

Privacy.com gives information about the merchants you purchase from to your bank by default. Their paid "discreet merchants" feature hides merchant information from your bank, so your bank only sees that a purchase was made with Privacy.com but not where that money was spent, however that is not foolproof, and of course Privacy.com still has knowledge about the merchants you are spending money with.

### MySudo (US, Paid)

**MySudo** provides up to 9 virtual cards depending on the plan you purchase. Their paid plans additionally include functionality which may be useful for making purchases privately, such as virtual phone numbers and email addresses, although we typically recommend other [email aliasing providers](email.md) for extensive email aliasing use.
