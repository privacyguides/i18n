Donate to Privacy Guides and support our mission to defend digital rights and spread the word about mass surveillance programs and other daily privacy invasions. You can help Privacy Guides researchers, activists, and maintainers create informative content, host private digital services, and protect privacy rights at a time when the world needs it most.

Privacy Guides has been a nonstop effort for over 5 years to stay up to date with the world of cybersecurity and privacy, and to promote the benefits of privacy overall. This is a **non-profit, community-driven** project that would not be possible without the generous support of all our [contributors](contributors.md).

## Donate

MAGIC Grants is our fiscal host, and their custom, open-source donation platform allows you to donate to our project with **Monero**, **Bitcoin**, or **debit/credit card**.

[Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/privacyguides){ class="md-button" }

Donating with Monero will maximize your donation by lowering our transaction fees while simultaneously [preserving your privacy](../cryptocurrency.md), win-win! You can also donate to us via GitHub Sponsors if you prefer, or if you would like to publicize your support. GitHub does not charge us any fees if you donate as an individual, but may charge us fees if you donate with a GitHub organization, if this is a concern for you.
