# Exported Translations

This is an archive of translations on Crowdin, updated daily. This repo is not used for building the final website. Pull Requests here will be rejected, to help translate the site please [join the project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides). If you have additional questions, feel free to [ask on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#pg-i18n:aragon.sh).

If you want to build a translated version of this site locally using these files, you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/blob/main/README.md#local-translated-site-builds), replacing steps 1-3 with:

1. Copy the `/includes`, `/i18n`, and `/theme` folders from this repo to the root of the [privacyguides.org](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org) repo.
