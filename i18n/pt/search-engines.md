description: These privacy-respecting search engines don't build an advertising profile based on your searches.

Use um motor de busca que n√£o construa um perfil publicit√°rio baseado nas suas pesquisas.

As recomenda√ß√µes aqui s√£o baseadas nos m√©ritos da pol√≠tica de privacidade de cada servi√ßo. H√° **sem garantia** de que estas pol√≠ticas de privacidade sejam honradas.

Considere usar um [VPN](/vpn) ou [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) se o seu modelo de amea√ßa requer esconder o seu endere√ßo IP do fornecedor de pesquisa.

    DuckDuckGo est√° sediado em üá∫üá∏ US.

The search engine relies on a commercial Bing API to serve most results, but it does use numerous [other sources](https://help.duckduckgo.com/results/sources/) for instant answers and other non-primary results.
    
    DuckDuckGo is the default search engine for the Tor Browser and is one of the few available options on Apple‚Äôs Safari browser.

DuckDuckGo is based in the United States. Their [privacy policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy) states they **do** log your searches for product improvement purposes, but not your IP address or any other personally identifying information.

DuckDuckGo offers two [other versions](https://help.duckduckgo.com/features/non-javascript/) of their search engine, both of which do not require JavaScript. These versions do lack features, however. These versions can also be used in conjunction with their [Tor onion address](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/) by appending [/lite](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/lite) or [/html](https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/html) for the respective version.

    **Startpage** √© um motor de pesquisa que fornece resultados de pesquisa do Google. √â uma forma muito conveniente de obter resultados de pesquisa no Google sem experimentar padr√µes escuros, tais como capturas dif√≠ceis ou acesso recusado porque voc√™ usou um [VPN](/vpn) ou [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

SearXNG is a proxy between you and the search engines it aggregates from. Your search queries will still be sent to the search engines that SearXNG gets its results from.

When self-hosting, it is important that you have other people using your instance so that the queries would blend in. You should be careful with where and how you are hosting SearXNG, as people looking up illegal content on your instance could draw unwanted attention from authorities.

When you are using a SearXNG instance, be sure to go read their privacy policy. Since SearXNG instances may be modified by their owners, they do not necessarily reflect their privacy policy. Some instances run as a Tor hidden service, which may grant some privacy as long as your search queries does not contain PII.

    **Startpage** is a private search engine known for serving Google search results.  One of Startpage's unique features is the [Anonymous View](https://www.startpage.com/en/anonymous-view/), which puts forth efforts to standardize user activity to make it more difficult to be uniquely identified. The feature can be useful for hiding [some](https://support.startpage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4455540212116-The-Anonymous-View-Proxy-technical-details) network and browser properties. Unlike the name suggests, the feature should not be relied upon for anonymity. If you are looking for anonymity, use the [Tor Browser](tor.md#tor-browser) instead.

    Startpage regularly limits service access to certain IP addresses, such as IPs reserved for VPNs or Tor. [DuckDuckGo](#duckduckgo) and [Brave Search](#brave-search) are friendlier options if your threat model requires hiding your IP address from the search provider.

Startpage is based in the Netherlands. According to their [privacy policy](https://www.startpage.com/en/privacy-policy/), they log details such as: operating system, type of browser, and language. They do not log your IP address, search queries, or other personally identifying information.

Startpage's majority shareholder is System1 who is an adtech company. We don't believe that to be an issue as they have a distinctly separate [privacy policy](https://system1.com/terms/privacy-policy). The Privacy Guides team reached out to Startpage [back in 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118031008/https://blog.privacytools.io/relisting-startpage/) to clear up any concerns with System1's sizeable investment into the service. We were satisfied with the answers we received.
