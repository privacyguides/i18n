title: Commenter les PRs
description: Un guide sur la participation aux discussions sur les Pull Request.

Veuillez vous abstenir d'utiliser la boîte générale **Ajouter un commentaire** dans les PRs GitHub lorsque vous laissez un commentaire ou effectuez une évaluation.

![Ne pas utiliser la boîte générale "Ajouter un commentaire" dans GitHub](../assets/img/meta/pr-avoid-general-comments.png)

Les commentaires laissés de la sorte ne sont pas _threaded_, ce qui rend difficile le suivi de plusieurs conversations.

Comments that are instead left in the manner described below will have a built-in reply box to keep conversations in a single thread. These comments can also be marked as resolved afterwards, so that discussion can be tracked more easily.

## Commenting

To start a threaded comment, you should leave all comments under the :octicons-file-diff-16: **Files changed** tab in a PR.

![Screenshot of the tabs for a pull request. The "Files changed" tab is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23571/mw-1440/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-tabs-changed-files.webp)

To leave a _general_ comment on a PR, click the :octicons-comment-16: comment icon to the right of a file:

![Screenshot of an image file on the "Files changed" page of a pull request. To the right of the file, a comment icon is outlined in orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-73771/mw-1440/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-comment-on-file.webp)

If the PR has multiple files changed, comment on the primary or most relevant file changed, or comment on the first file if you can't decide.

To leave a comment _on a specific line_ of a PR, hover over the line where you'd like to add a comment, and click the blue comment icon:

(Optionally, you can add a comment on multiple lines. You can click the line number of the first line you want to comment on and drag down to select a range of lines, then click the blue comment icon on the last line you want to comment on. Alternatively, you can click the blue comment icon next to the first line you want to comment on, then drag down to the last line you want to comment on.)

Then, type your comment and click **Add single comment**.

## Reviewing

When performing a review, follow the same steps as above, but click **Start a review** (and subsequently, **Add a review comment**) instead of **Add single comment**.

Then, click the green **Finish your review** button at the top of the page.

Do not leave any discussion comments in the _Leave a comment_ box in the review finalization pop-up. You can leave it blank, or leave a short note if it will not require any follow-up. To comment on something that will require further discussion, add a comment on a file as described above instead.

Then, click **Submit review**.
