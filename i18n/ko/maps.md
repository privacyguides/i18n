- [:material-account-cash: Surveillance Capitalism](basics/common-threats.md#surveillance-as-a-business-model){ .pg-brown }

Use a **map and navigation app** that doesn't build an advertising profile based on your searches and location history. Instead of using Google Maps, Apple Maps, or Waze, we recommend these privacy-respecting alternatives.

The recommendations here either do not collect any user data or at least do not collect personally identifying information (PII) based on each service's privacy policy. There is **no guarantee** that these privacy policies are honored.

## Organic Maps

**Organic Maps** is an open source, community-developed map display and satnav-style navigation app for walkers, drivers, and cyclists. The app offers worldwide offline maps based on OpenStreetMap data, and navigation with privacy — no location tracking, no data collection, and no ads. The app can be used completely offline.

Features include cycling routes, hiking trails and walking paths, turn-by-turn navigation with voice guidance, and public transport route planning (only available in supported regions and cities).

Please note that Organic Maps is a simple, basic app that lacks certain features many users might expect, such as satellite images, street view images, and real-time traffic information.

## OsmAnd

Compared to Organic Maps, OsmAnd has more [features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAnd#Features) but is also more complicated to use. One noteworthy feature is the ability to overlay or underlay external map data, such as satellite images from Microsoft or [traffic data](https://web.archive.org/web/20211203063453/http://themm.net/public/osmand_traffic) from Google, although the latter is ignored by the automatic route planning. OsmAnd also has an optional integration of street view images provided by [Mapillary](https://mapillary.com).
