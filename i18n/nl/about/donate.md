Donate to Privacy Guides and support our mission to defend digital rights and spread the word about mass surveillance programs and other daily privacy invasions. You can help Privacy Guides researchers, activists, and maintainers create informative content, host private digital services, and protect privacy rights at a time when the world needs it most.

Privacy Guides has been a nonstop effort for over 5 years to stay up to date with the world of cybersecurity and privacy, and to promote the benefits of privacy overall. This is a **non-profit, community-driven** project that would not be possible without the generous support of all our [contributors](contributors.md).

## Donate

Currently, the best way to support our work is to send a monthly or one-time contribution via GitHub Sponsors. We will be able to accept donations via alternate payment platforms very soon.

[:material-heart:{ .pg-red } Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/privacyguides){ class="md-button md-button--primary" }

A new donation platform we control to make donating easier will be deployed soon. In the meantime, if you'd like to arrange a donation (including with cryptocurrency), please reach out to [info@magicgrants.org](mailto:info@magicgrants.org).

## Hoe we donaties gebruiken

Privacy Guides is een **non-profit** organisatie. Wij gebruiken donaties voor verschillende doeleinden, waaronder:

**Web Hosting**
:

Het verkeer naar deze website verbruikt honderden gigabytes aan gegevens per maand, wij maken gebruik van verschillende dienstverleners om dit verkeer bij te houden.

**Domain Registrations**
:

We have a few domain names like `privacyguides.org` which cost us around $10 yearly to maintain their registration.

**Online diensten**
:

We host [internet services](services.md) for testing and showcasing different privacy-products we like and [recommend](../tools.md). Some of them are made publicly available for our community's use (SearXNG, Tor, etc.), and some are provided for our team members (email, etc.).

**Aankopen van producten**
:

Wij kopen af en toe producten en diensten aan om onze [aanbevolen instrumenten te testen](../tools.md).

Your donation will go to a [dedicated fund](https://magicgrants.org/funds/privacy_guides) within [MAGIC Grants](https://magicgrants.org), a 501(c)(3) organization. The funds will only be used for this project specifically. You may qualify for a tax deduction. If you need a donation receipt, please email <info@magicgrants.org>.

Thank you to all those who support our mission! :material-heart:{ .pg-red }

We strictly **cannot** use donations to support political campaigns/candidates or attempt to influence legislation. Earnings also will **not** inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.

## Merchandise

Een andere optie om ons te steunen is door onze merchandise te kopen bij HelloTux. We get a small commission for each item sold, and you get a quality product to show for it.

## Non-Financial Support

It takes a lot of [people](contributors.md) and [work](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pulse/monthly) to keep Privacy Guides up to date and spread the word about privacy and mass surveillance. If you're looking for other ways to help out, consider getting involved by [editing the site](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org), [joining our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net), or [contributing translations](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides).
